## Introduction
The **Extraction and Verification of Information from Semi-Categorized Data** project aims to automate the process of verifying documents submitted for recruitment or examinations. Using advanced AI and NLP techniques, the system enhances the efficiency and accuracy of data extraction and validation from semi-structured and unstructured documents.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual verification of documents such as certificates, scorecards, and forms is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks scalability. Additionally, these documents may be in various formats (PDF, images) and languages, further complicating the process.

---

## Solution
An **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** system powered by AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to:
- Extract relevant information from documents.
- Verify data against predefined criteria.
- Provide real-time alerts for discrepancies, enabling corrections during submission.

---

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Extract names, dates, PAN numbers, and other relevant details using OCR and NLP.
- **Validation**: Verify extracted information for accuracy and integrity.
- **Interactive Modules**:
  - **HR Module**: Match resumes with job descriptions and validate application details.
  - **Competitive Exam Module**: Verify eligibility and ensure form correctness.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Alerts for mismatched or incomplete data during form submission.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pytesseract, Pandas, NumPy
- **Tools**: Figma for UI/UX design

---

## Dataset Preparation
- **Collection**: Gather semi-structured and unstructured documents in PDF and image formats.
- **Annotation**: Label entities like names, dates, and identifiers for model training.
- **Attributes**: Include textual content, layout information, and metadata.

---
